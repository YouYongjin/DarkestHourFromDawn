Shader issues such as pink shaders means you have a different render pipeline.

If you are using Standard Render Pipeline also knows as Built-In RP, and you are looking at URP or HDRP shaders,
the will render pink due to missing rendering dependancies.

If you are using Universal Render Pipeline and looking at Built-In or HDRP you will also see pink shaders.

If you are using HD Render Pipeline and looking at Built-In or URP you will also see pink shaders.
